# EDA_TO_DASHBOARD

In this project, I transformed the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data into an interactive Tableau dashboard. I began by analyzing the dataset to uncover key insights about customer booking patterns, cancellations, lead times, and more. After identifying significant trends through EDA using Python, I translated these findings into a visually engaging Tableau dashboard. By doing so, I provided a comprehensive view of the hotel's performance metrics, enabling better decision-making and data-driven strategies for stakeholders.
